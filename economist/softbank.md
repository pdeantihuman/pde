交易员一般嘴上功夫都很油滑。但是哪种金融分支需要最强的技巧呢？那必须是位于硅谷的投资银行家们。投资银行家为了贩卖昂贵的风险必须要有银舌。

他们总是对一些时髦的词津津乐道，比如"虚荣指标"（公司与估值不符的比例），"产品-市场匹配度"（公司的产品与市场的契合程度）。

有一个话题必定能打开他们的话匣子，那便是涌入规格的资本。以前风险投资是一艘小渔船在一个物产丰富的湖上钓鱼。现在则是许多捕捞船在捕捞。

现在的科技公司相比之下停留在私有阶段的时间更长了，一方面是因为资本的涌入。因为上市之后公司的增长可能已经停止了，这样的恐慌促使人们去在公司的早期阶段，未上市阶段予以投资。另一方面也是因为公司并不需要这么多资本，因此权力的平衡在从资本供给方向企业家转移。

估值不可避免地过高了，WeWork是个很好的例子。WeWork一月时估值高达470亿。上市前由于投资者对于价格标定非常踌躇不定，IPO被终止了。软银为了纾困付出了80亿美元。软银的损失是无法估量的。

Traders are usually slick in their verbal skills.  But which branch of finance needs the strongest skills?  That must be venture capitals based in Silicon Valley.  Investment bankers must have a silver tongue in order to sell expensive risks.

They are always fond of talking about some fashionable words, such as "vanity index" (the ratio of the company to the valuation) and "product-market matching degree" (the matching degree between the company's products and the market).

One topic that will surely open their conversation is the influx of capital into specifications.  Venture capital used to be a small fishing boat fishing on a rich lake.  Now many fishing boats are fishing.

Today's technology companies have stayed in the private sector longer than before, partly because of the influx of capital.  Because the growth of the company may have stopped after the listing, such panic has prompted people to invest in the early stages of the company and the unlisted stage.  On the other hand, because the company does not need so much capital, the balance of power is shifting from capital supply to entrepreneurs.

The valuation is inevitably too high, WeWork is a good example.  WeWork was valued at 47 billion yuan in January.  Before the IPO, the IPO was terminated because investors were very hesitant about pricing.  Softbank paid $8 billion for the rescue.  Softbank's losses are incalculable.
