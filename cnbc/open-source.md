# The rise of open source software

Open source software is maintained by countless volunteer developers. Anyone can download the source code of Facebook's User interface, Goldman Sachs' data model, Google's Android operating system, and can be used into another totally different project. 

Proprietary software 是一个非常lucrative business，it creates the incentive of 公司例如 IBM。

开源软件的影响力非常大。Fortune 500 中 99% 都依赖于开源软件。lines of code in many vehicles are much more than it in a F-15，code is too much to be written by single organiation. 



开源世界最大的问题是，开源项目缺乏盈利模式，也缺乏审计。OpenSSL 是个很坏的影响。OpenSSL 由很小的一个团队维护，唯一的收入是捐献。OpenSSL 被发现有heartbleed 漏洞，Facebook 的密码, Google的密码，信用卡密码等等都有可能被泄漏。
